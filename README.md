# Apple_apps_data_analysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Apple App Store data using SQL. Here's a quick summary of what I did:

- Checked the number of unique apps in both the 'AppleStore' and 'appleStore_description' tables to ensure data consistency.
- Examined missing values in key fields like 'track_name,' 'user_rating,' 'prime_genre,' and 'app_desc.'
- Determined the number of apps per genre to gain insights into genre popularity.
- Analyzed app ratings by finding the minimum, maximum, and average user ratings.
- Investigated whether paid apps had higher ratings than free apps.
- Explored the relationship between the number of supported languages and user ratings.
- Identified genres with the lowest average ratings.
- Checked if there was a correlation between the length of app descriptions and user ratings.
- Identified the top-rated apps for each genre based on user ratings and total ratings counts.
- This project demonstrates my ability to extract valuable insights from data, conduct statistical analyses, and make data-driven decisionsâ€”a valuable skillset for data analysis and decision-making roles.
